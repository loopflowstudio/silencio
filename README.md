# Silencio

An RL-trainable music environment with symbolic + embedding representations.

## Vision

Real-time responsive AI musicians. Start with a smart metronome, build up to collaborative band members.

## Core Concepts

**Two Spaces:**
- **Symbolic** (music theory): pitch, scale, rhythm, harmony — discrete, interpretable
- **Embedding** (timbre): continuous vectors mapped from text/audio — learnable, interpolatable

**Score**: The core abstraction. A sequence of beats, each with timing info + timbre embedding. Think "digital sheet music with sound character."

## Status

🚧 Early development. See `scratch/design.md` for current spec.
